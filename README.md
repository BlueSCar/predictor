Application for generating college football score and win probability predictions

# method

This application utilizes two different neural networks (NN) generated using the SynapticJS library.  The first NN outputs game score predictions.  The second NN outputs win probability percentage for the home team

# data

The neural networks utilize a variety of play- and drive-based data.  Additional data incorporated includes a team's talent level based on recruiting data as well as home-field advantage as well as whether the game takes place at a neutral site and if it is a conference competition.
